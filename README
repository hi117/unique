UNIQUE

"Unique" is a Java clone of "Endgame: Singularity" by Evil Mr Henry et al, which
can be found at http://www.emhsoft.com/singularity/. Instead of Python, this
version of the game requires Java 1.7.

In version 0.1.0, you're tasked with the important mission of keeping an integer
value nonnegative for five difficult action-packed turns. But beware, the forces
of Evil are always trying to decrease your value! Protect it at all costs, even
if you have to manually increase the value!
