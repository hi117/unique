UNIQUE

"Unique" is a Java clone of "Endgame: Singularity" by Evil Mr Henry et al, which
can be found at http://www.emhsoft.com/singularity/. Instead of Python, this
version of the game requires Java 1.7.

In version 0.2.0, you're tasked with the important mission of keeping an integer
value nonnegative for 20 seconds of exciting gameplay. But beware, the forces
of Evil are always trying to decrease your value! Protect it at all costs, even
if you have to manually increase the value!
